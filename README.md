# netio230a: A Python class to interface the Koukaam NETIO 230A via TCP/IP.

## Project Information

This software (netio230a) provides an interface via TCP to control the Koukaam
NETIO 230A. The software consists of a class to represent the possibilities of
the product and example code to show how to use it. It also provides a command
line tool to switch on and off ports on the NETIO230A.

If you have an idea for the software or want to report a bug, let me know via
email!

## Required Python modules

This project uses the standard python modules socket, hashlib, re, math, time,
datetime, shlex and sys. The gui (netio230a_gui.py) needs pygtk installed.

## Installation and Usage

The software is tested and known to work on Ubuntu Linux (since 9.04 Jaunty) and
on Microsoft Windows XP. It should, however, work on any operating system that
supports python (and PyGTK for the GUI).

Please refer to the Wiki site
<http://wiki.github.com/pklaus/netio230a/installation-howto> for information on
how to install and use the software.

For Ubuntu and Debian there are ready to use .deb installation packages. Please
refer to [the wiki page on the .deb
packages](https://wiki.github.com/pklaus/netio230a/Debian-and-Ubuntu-packages-for-netio230a).
