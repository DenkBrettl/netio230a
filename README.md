# netio230a: A Python class to interface the Koukaam NETIO 230A via TCP/IP.

## Project Information

This software (netio230a) provides an interface via TCP to control 
the Koukaam NETIO 230A.
The software consists of a class to represent the possibilities of 
the product and example code to show how to use it.
It also provides a command line tool to switch on and off ports on the NETIO230A.

## Moving Forward

I hope that someone will join the team as I have no time yet to complete
the class. If you know Python and want to contribute, then please join the team!

## Required Python modules

This project uses the python modules socket, hashlib, re, math, time, datetime, shlex and sys.
The example.gui.py file needs pygtk installed.

## Installation and Usage

The software is tested and known to work on Ubuntu Linux 9.04 Jaunty and on Microsoft Windows XP.
It should, however, work on any operating system that supports python (and PyGTK for the GUI).

Please refer to the Wiki site <http://wiki.github.com/pklaus/netio230a/installation-howto>
for information on how to install and use the software.
