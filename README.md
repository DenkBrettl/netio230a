# netio230a: A Python class to interface the Koukaam NETIO 230A via TCP/IP.

## Project Information

This software (netio230a) provides an interface via TCP to control 
the Koukaam NETIO 230A.
The software consists of a class to represent the possibilities of 
the product and example code to show how to use it.

## Moving Forward

I hope that someone will join the team as I have no time yet to complete
the class. If you know Python and want to contribute, then please join the team!

## Required frame-works

This project uses the python modules socket, ... and the example.gui.py file
needs pygtk installed.
